# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System (LMS) is a web-based platform that streamlines cataloging, circulation, and patron services for academic and community libraries. For patrons, the LMS provides modern search and discovery (by title, author, ISBN, subject), account management, holds/waitlists, renewals, due-date reminders, and visibility into fines and payments. For librarians, it centralizes inventory (add/edit/withdraw items, batch import), checkout/return workflows with barcodes, configurable fine rules, hold queue management, and reporting dashboards for circulation and collection performance. Administrators gain role-based access control, audit logs, backup/export tools, and optional SSO.

Technically, the LMS centers on a Java Spring Boot backend with a PostgreSQL database and a search engine (e.g., OpenSearch/Elasticsearch) for fast, faceted catalog queries. A responsive UI (staff console + patron portal) supports barcode/QR scanning, notifications (email/SMS), payment gateway integration for fines, and accessibility per WCAG 2.1 AA. The system is containerized for easy deployment to on-prem or cloud, with CI/CD via GitHub Actions. The MVP scope focuses on catalog search, checkout/return, holds, basic fines, and essential reportsâ€”leaving RFID, deep analytics, and advanced e-resources integration as stretch goals.
